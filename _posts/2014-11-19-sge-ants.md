# Ants on the Unacloud cluster using SGE

## Background

We got the challenge to generate an [Ants](https://github.com/stnava/ANTs) template from 211 images. We had runned ants in the past in a machine containing 32 cores and with 40 images the process took about 8 days. We approximated that in order to calculate this template in the same machine it would take abut a month of processing time. We would have to keep this machine all the time fully dedicated to this task. This was not possible as this machine is usually moved around the lab for different projects. Therefore we decided to try to run Ants in a cluster environment. 

Our university has a cluster platform called [unacloud](https://sistemas.uniandes.edu.co/~unacloud/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=inicio). It uses the computers in several computer rooms by running virtual machines in the background. These virtual machines are copied from an existing image and afterwards its name and ip address are changed. There are several tutorials around the web about installing sge, but here we will summarize the process that worked for us. For more information look at the [bibliography](#biblio) of this post.

In this examples we are going to use a Fedora server, and Debian clients. We divide the process in the following steps:

1. A nfs shared file system
2. A bind dns server
3. SGE 
4. Ants 
5. Deploying in unacloud

## 1 NFS

### Server

We need to create a folder for , for example `/home/canguro/nfs` and add it to the exports file. The exports file should look like this
